# third_project
basic password registration/login system

TO IMPROVE:
- Use functions to decrease repeatability
- use dictionary to store the passwords and also store the usernames of people
- Provide the user with an attempt counter after each invalid code entrance
- More Error handling to handle incorrect formats and restricted characters (if any will be added)
